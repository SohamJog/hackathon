## A Decentralized Crowd-Sourced News Website:
This is a ***Blockchain-Based*** website where you post news articles and people can vote on how credible the news resource is.

Users post **news articles** on the website. These articles are public and anyone can **upvote/downvote** your post.

It is safe to assume that a majority of people donâ€™t upvote/downvote for no reason because there is an **incentive structure** involved. You pay to make a
voice heard, you pay to tell the world if some article is clearly wrong, and you get PAID if the news you posted is deemed credible enough.

We aim to minimize **misinformation** and **trolling** through this incentivization. 



## Why Blockchain
***Decentralized*** - you own your own data.  

***Anonymous***, if you want it to be  

***Permissionless*** - Anyone can join. All voices need to be heard  

***Censorship Resistant***

***Secure payments*** - Without relying on banks or other intermediaries 



## What We Did: 
We made use of the **Solana Blockchain** for our project. 

Solana is one of the **fastest blockchains** out there with an estimated 50000 transactions-per-second  

In decentralized apps, the backend is handled by a **SMART CONTRACT**. 

We coded on top of some example smart contracts provided by solana(specifically, their twitter smart contract)  
You can find the smart contracts in **social/programs/social** 

For the frontend, we used React.js  
You can find the frontend code in **social/app**
